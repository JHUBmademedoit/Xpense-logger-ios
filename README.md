# Xpense Logger

This is my expense tracking app that I made for a coding assignment. It lets you take photos of receipts and keep track of how much money you need to claim back.

What it does

- Take photos of your receipts with your phone camera
- Type in how much each receipt is worth
- Shows you the total amount of all your receipts
- Saves everything so you don't lose it when you close the app

How I built it

I used Swift and Xcode to make this app. It was pretty tricky at first but I figured it out eventually. The camera was the hardest bit.

Problems I had

The biggest problem was getting the camera to work. It kept giving me errors but turns out you have to test it on a real phone, not just the simulator.

How to run it

You need Xcode and an iPhone. Open the project file and run it on your phone (not the simulator because the camera won't work).

Assignment Requirements

This app meets all the requirements for JCS Module 2:
- Takes photos with timestamps
- Lets you enter amounts manually
- Shows running total
- Easy to use
- Code is on GitHub
